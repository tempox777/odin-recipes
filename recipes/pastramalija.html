  <h1>But what is Pastramalija?</h1>

  <p>Pastramalija is a Macedonian dish, made with slightly chewy dough that is absolutely delicious, it's made with eggs inside the empty space in the dough in the middle, it marinates the dough and makes it super delicious, on top of the eggs is where the meat is, usually pork or lamb, generally you can ask it to be with meat of your choosing but thats how its traditionally eaten </p>
