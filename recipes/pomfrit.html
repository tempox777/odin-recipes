  <!-- Ingredients-->


  <h1>
    Ingredients
  </h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Frying pan</strong> We need a frying pan as macedonian fries are fried not baked.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sunflower oil</strong> Macedonians generally use sunflower oil as a staple for all foods, you could fry it with something else but sunflower oil gives a distinct taste to the fries that you wont get with something else.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fresh natural potatoes</strong> Try to get natural white potatoes, they are da best!
    </li>
  </ul>

    How to make the Macedonian Pomfrit!
  </h1> 

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Put the pan to heat up</strong> Let the pan heat up for a minute
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Put the sunflower oil in the pan</strong> Now that our frying pan is warm, put the sunflower oil inside, it should generally be filled 1 to 2cm, not too much but not little, we want it be generally filled, use your best judgement
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cut the fires</strong>While we wait for the sunflower oil to get hot, cut your fries, they should be long and medium in width, do the best job you can, Macedonians use a knife to do this, traditional, although you can get modern if you want!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Put the fries inside</strong> Once the sunflower oil is heated up and your fries ready,  put the fries inside, make sure to stir them every 2-3 minutes, it will take about 20-30 minutes for them to fry, they should be crispy but not brown or burned, white white some crips on the side!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Enjoy!</strong>If you did all steps above correctly, they will be the best fries you have ever tried, nice and crispy with a beatiful white color, just right! Check out our other recipes if you liked this one and we know you did haha! :) (hopefully)
